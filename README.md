# IPL_Analysis  -- My first hands on experience in Apache Spark.
This Project aims at doing simple data analysis using the IPL data downloaded from Kaggle.com.
I have used Apache Spark in standalone mode to do the data analysis.
Below are the data analysis done,
1. Total Runs scored by each batsman in each match
2. Batting average of each Batsman.

Input Data File:
Below are the columns present in the input csv file:
match_id	
inning	
batting_team	
bowling_team	
over	
ball	
batsman	
non_striker	
bowler	
is_super_over	
wide_runs	
bye_runs	
legbye_runs	
noball_runs	
penalty_runs	
batsman_runs	
extra_runs	
total_runs	
player_dismissed	
dismissal_kind	
fielder

as we can see, the input data file contains information of every match ball by ball.
